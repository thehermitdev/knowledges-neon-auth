> Summary: Managed Better Auth is a managed authentication service built on Better Auth. It stores users, sessions, and OAuth configuration in your database under the neon_auth schema, compatible with Row Level Security. Every database branch gets its own isolated auth environment, so you can test sign-up, login, and OAuth flows in preview or CI branches without touching production.

# Managed Better Auth

Managed authentication that branches with your database

**Note: Beta**

The **Managed Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Managed Better Auth is the managed authentication service in the Neon backend for apps and agents. It stores users, sessions, and auth configuration directly in your Neon database. When you branch your database, your entire auth state branches with it, so you can test real authentication workflows in preview environments.

## Quick start guides

Choose your framework to get started:

- [Next.js](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/nextjs-api-only): Quick start with API methods
- [React](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/react): Quick start with API methods
- [TanStack Router](https://neon.com/docs/auth/quick-start/tanstack-router): With UI components

## Set up with your AI editor

The fastest way to connect your editor to Managed Better Auth is to run `npx neon@latest init` from your project root:

```bash
npx neon@latest init
```

This command configures the [Neon MCP server](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server) and installs **[Agent Skills](https://neon.com/docs/ai/agent-skills)** (`neon-postgres`) in your project. Together they help you set up Managed Better Auth in two ways:

1. **Configure Managed Better Auth on your branch (MCP).** After `init`, ask your assistant to enable and configure auth in natural language. The MCP server exposes:

   - `provision_neon_auth`: Enable Managed Better Auth on a branch
   - `configure_neon_auth`: Set OAuth providers, email, sign-in methods, trusted domains, and more
   - `get_neon_auth_config`: Read the current configuration

   See [Neon MCP Server: Managed Better Auth tools](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#supported-actions-tools) for details.

2. **Add Managed Better Auth to your application (Agent Skills).** Skills teach your assistant how to install the SDK, environment variables, and routes for your framework. Use the quick start guides on this page, or ask your assistant directly.

**Example prompt:**

```text
Set up Managed Better Auth for my project. Enable Google OAuth and email/password sign-in,
and set the application name to "My App".
```

You can also enable Managed Better Auth in the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech) (Project → Branch → Auth) and configure settings manually.

## Why Managed Better Auth?

- **Identity lives in your database**  
  All authentication data is stored in the `neon_auth` schema. It's queryable with SQL and compatible with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

- **Zero server management**  
  Managed Better Auth runs as a managed REST API service. Configure settings in the Console; use the [client SDK](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk) or [server SDK](https://neon.com/docs/auth/reference/nextjs-server) in your app. No infrastructure to maintain.

- **Auth that branches with your data**  
  Test sign-up, login, password reset, and OAuth flows in isolated branches without touching production data.

## Built on Better Auth

Managed Better Auth is powered by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), which means you get familiar APIs. You can use Better Auth UI components or call auth methods directly to build your own UI.

Managed Better Auth currently supports Better Auth version **1.4.18**.

### When to use Managed Better Auth vs. self-hosting Better Auth

Managed Better Auth is a managed authentication service built into Lakebase Postgres on Neon:

- **Branch-aware authentication**: Every Neon branch gets its own isolated auth environment, so you can test authentication features without affecting your production branch.
- **Built-in Data API integration**: JWT token validation for the Data API has native support for Managed Better Auth.
- **No infrastructure to manage**: Managed Better Auth is deployed in the same region as your database, reducing latency without requiring you to run auth infrastructure.
- **Shared OAuth credentials for testing**: Get started quickly with out-of-the-box Google OAuth credentials, eliminating the setup complexity for testing and prototyping.

Self-hosting Better Auth makes sense if you need:

- Flexibility in auth configuration: custom plugins, hooks, and options not yet supported by Managed Better Auth.
- Full control over your auth code and the ability to run it inside your own infrastructure.

For more details on the SDK differences between `@neondatabase/auth` and `better-auth/client`, see [Why use @neondatabase/auth over better-auth/client](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-js/blob/main/packages/auth/neon-auth_vs_better-auth.md).

As Managed Better Auth evolves, more Better Auth integrations and features will be added. Check the [roadmap](https://neon.com/docs/auth/roadmap) to see what's currently supported and what's coming next.

## Basic usage

Enable Auth in the Neon Console or [with your AI editor](https://neon.com/docs/auth/overview#set-up-with-your-ai-editor), then add authentication to your app.

**For Next.js (server-side):**

See the [Next.js Server SDK reference](https://neon.com/docs/auth/reference/nextjs-server) for complete API documentation.

```typescript filename="lib/auth/server.ts"
import { createNeonAuth } from '@neondatabase/auth/next/server';

export const auth = createNeonAuth({
  baseUrl: process.env.NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL!,
  cookies: { secret: process.env.NEON_AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET! },
});
```

```typescript filename="app/api/auth/[...path]/route.ts"
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth/server';

export const { GET, POST } = auth.handler();
```

**For React/Vite (client-side):**

See the [Client SDK reference](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk) for complete API documentation. If you want one client for both Neon Auth and the Data API, initialize `createClient()` from a single Neon URL as shown in [`createClient()` initialization](https://neon.com/docs/reference/javascript-sdk#initializing).

```typescript filename="src/auth.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from '@neondatabase/neon-js/auth';

export const authClient = createAuthClient(import.meta.env.VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL);
```

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import { NeonAuthUIProvider, AuthView } from '@neondatabase/auth-ui';
import { authClient } from './auth';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NeonAuthUIProvider authClient={authClient}>
      <AuthView pathname="sign-in" />
    </NeonAuthUIProvider>
  );
}
```

## Use cases

- **Production authentication**  
  Use Managed Better Auth as the identity system for your app. Store users, sessions, and OAuth configuration directly in Postgres, and pair with RLS for secure, database-centric access control.

- **Preview environments**  
  Test full authentication flows in Vercel previews with real users and sessions

- **Multi-tenant SaaS**  
  Test complex org and role hierarchies safely in isolated branches

- **CI/CD workflows**  
  Run end-to-end auth tests without touching production. The [Neon Create Branch GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/neon-create-branch-github-action) supports retrieving branch-specific auth URLs for testing authentication flows in GitHub Actions workflows.

- **Development workflows**  
  Spin up complete environments instantly with database and auth together

See [Branching authentication](https://neon.com/docs/auth/branching-authentication) for details on how auth branches with your database.

## Example applications

Beyond the quick starts on this site, the [neondatabase/neon-js](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-js) monorepo ships **more runnable Managed Better Auth and `neon-js` samples** under [`examples/`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-js/tree/main/examples), including plugin demos (see [Plugins](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/plugins#example-applications)), Next.js and React apps, cross-subdomain setups, alternative UI stacks, and Data API patterns. Each folder includes its own README (many workflows use **bun** from the repository root). Browse there when you want a full project to clone next to the guides here.

## Availability

Managed Better Auth is currently available for AWS regions only. Azure support is not yet available.

Managed Better Auth does not currently support projects with [IP Allow](https://neon.com/docs/manage/projects#configure-ip-allow) or [Private Networking](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-private-networking) enabled.

## Pricing

Managed Better Auth is included in all Neon plans based on Monthly Active Users (MAU):

- **Free**: Up to 60,000 MAU
- **Launch**: Up to 1M MAU
- **Scale**: Up to 1M MAU

An MAU (Monthly Active User) is a unique user who authenticates at least once during a monthly billing period. If you need more than 1M MAU, request an increase in the [console feedback form](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings?modal=feedback\&modalparams=%22Neon%20auth%20limit%20increase%22).

See [Neon plans](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans#auth) for more details.

## Migration from Stack Auth

If you're using the previous Neon Auth implementation via Stack Auth, your version will continue to work. When you're ready to migrate to the new Better Auth implementation, see our [migration guide](https://neon.com/docs/auth/migrate/from-legacy-auth).
