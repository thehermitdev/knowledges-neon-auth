# Plugins

Supported Better Auth plugins in Managed Better Auth

**Note: Beta**

The **Managed Better Auth** is in Beta. Share your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp) or via the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback).

Managed Better Auth is built on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), which supports a variety of plugins to extend authentication functionality.

**Info: Plugins are managed by Managed Better Auth**

Managed Better Auth is a **managed** Better Auth service. You **don't install or configure Better Auth plugins directly** - instead, Managed Better Auth exposes a supported subset of plugins through the Neon SDK.

For plugins that have Console settings (for example [Organization](https://neon.com/docs/auth/guides/plugins/organization)), open **Auth** > **Plugins** (beta) in the Neon Console, or use the Neon API. Additional plugin options may still arrive over time; see the [Managed Better Auth roadmap](https://neon.com/docs/auth/roadmap).

The following Better Auth plugins are currently supported in Managed Better Auth:
